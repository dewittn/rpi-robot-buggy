# Remote controlling your buggy with a VPN

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** This tutorial is still a work in progress and may need some editing for clarity.

---
In honor of NASA's Perseverance rover landing on Mars, my student and I wanted to try remote controlling a buggy thousands of miles aways. To do this, we will need to install a VPN on both the _Buggy Pi_, and the _Controller Pi_. An optional step is to setup a public server that can act as a go between.
We will also a need a server that is connected to the internet host the VPN and send signals back and forth. 

I use Linode as my hosting provider. They have very affordable plans start at $5/month.

In this tutorial we will be installing, and setting the WireGuard VPN on Raspberry Pi OS. I like WireGuard because it is very fast, and relatively simple to get setup.


## Step 1: Update System

Before we install WireGuard we want to make sure our _Buggy Pi_ and _Controller Pi_ are both running the latest software. You can update each system by running the following commands:

```
sudo apt update 
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Step 2: Install WireGuard

As of March 2021, WireGuard is part of the main Raspberry Pi OS repository. so after you update, you should be able to install WireGuard with this command:

```
sudo apt install wireguard
```

**üìù Note:** You will need to install WireGaurd on both your _Buggy Pi_ and _Controller Pi_

## Step 3: Create WireGuard Keys

Before you setup your config file you must generate public and private keys. First, generate keys on our the _Controller Pi_.
```
umask 077
wg genkey > controller.privatekey
wg pubkey < controller.privatekey > controller.publickey
```

Then run the same commands on your _Buggy Pi_.
```
umask 077
wg genkey > controller.privatekey
wg pubkey < controller.privatekey > controller.publickey
```

**üìù Note:** You can also generate keys with one command like this:
```
umask 077
wg genkey | tee controller.privatekey | wg pubkey > controller.publickey
```

## Step 4: Set up WireGuard Server

To connect Raspberry Pi's running on different networks we need to access to a server that is connected to the public internet. If you don't have access to a public server then you can still finish this project by setting up the _Controller Pi_ as the server.

Setting up a public server is outside the scope of this project, but here is a [Linode guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/set-up-wireguard-vpn-on-ubuntu/) on how to install WireGuard on an Ubuntu server.

Once you have logged into your sever you need to generate keys. If you are using the _Controller Pi_ as the server you can skip this step.

```
umask 077
wg genkey > server.privatekey
wg pubkey < server.privatekey > server.publickey
```

Next we need to setup the configuration file, `/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf`, for the Sever. Each device on our VPN will get it's own IP address. Our routing table looks something like this:

```
192.168.2.1 # For the Public server or the Controller Pi
192.168.2.2 # For the Buggy Pi
192.168.2.3 # For the Conroller if we have a public server.
```

The server conf will look something like this.
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Server Private Key>
Address = 192.168.3.1/32
SaveConfig = true
PostUp = iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
PostDown = iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE; ip6tables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; ip6tables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Buddy Public Key>
AllowedIPs = 192.168.3.2/24

## Do not add this block if the Controller is the Server
[Peer]
PublicKey = <Controller Public Key>
AllowedIPs = 192.168.3.3/24
```

`<Buddy Public Key>` is just a place holder. You will need to replace it with the actual contents of the `buggy.publickey` file. The key files are just plain text and can be opened in any text editor or by running `cat buggy.publickey`. 

Copy the contents of `buggy.publickey` and paste it into your config file. See [buggy-sample.conf](projects/vpn/buggy-sample.conf), [controller-sample.conf](projects/vpn/controller-sample.conf), and [server-sample.conf](projects/vpn/server-sample.conf) for examples of what final files should look like. 

**üìù Note:** **Do not use** the example `conf` files in your project. They are for demonstration purposes only and will not work.

## Step 5: Setup WireGuard Client(s)

Next we need to setup the WireGuard configuration file on both the controller pi, and the buggy pi. For a more detailed explanation on how setting up the WireGuard conf check out their website. 

To get your private key you can open `controller.privatekey` in a text editor or run this command `cat controller.privatekey` you should see a string of random letters and numbers like this:
```
$ cat controller.privatekey
kHE9qqbeloFxKaHOmhd0kuDhShGx5r2e45rtB9X2+V0=
```

now you need to the public key from the server:
```
$ cat server.publickey
7lTo3CyQ/5SJgxGgtHyWVwgAKmbIuzQhPt4L6z1ZqlY=
```

**üìù Note:** These keys are for demonstration purposes only. Please do not use in your actual config files.

`/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` on Controller device:
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Controller Private Key>
ListenPort = 21841
Address = 192.168.3.2/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Server Public Key>
Endpoint = <Server Public IP Address>:51820
## Using 0.0.0.0/0 will send ALL traffic through the VPN 
## where as using 192.168.3.0/24 will send only traffic 
# AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
AllowedIPs = 192.168.3.0/24
```

`/etc/wireguard/wg0.conf` on buggy device
```
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Buddy Private Key>
ListenPort = 21841
Address = 192.168.3.3/24

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Server Public Key>
Endpoint = <Server Public IP Address>:51820
## Using 0.0.0.0/0 will send ALL traffic through the VPN 
## where as using 192.168.3.0/24 will send only traffic 
# AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
AllowedIPs = 192.168.3.0/24
```

## Step 6: Start WireGuard

Once you have WireGuard setup you need so start the server service. You do this by running the following command on each device:
```
sudo wg-quick up wg0
```

If everything has been configured correctly you should be able to ping each device on the network:
```
ping 192.168.3.1
ping 192.168.3.2
ping 192.168.3.3
``` 

## Step 7: Modify Our Code

Using the code from `projects\remote-controller\robby-remote.py` modify the host with the new IP address.

```python
# To address this bug we set the global pin factory to the remote host
# and connect to the breadboard controller through a localhost pin_factory.
Device.pin_factory = PiGPIOFactory(host='192.168.3.3')
robot = Robot(left=(7,8), right=(9,10))
```

You should now be able to control your Pi over the VPN network.
