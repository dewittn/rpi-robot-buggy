## Background

Over the past couple of months I have been tutoring a high school student in programing. He is interested in robotics and I have been helping him build a robot buggy using Raspberry Pis. I'm a big fan of these tiny computers, and I wanted to try this project for my self. I'm publishing my code on GitHub for his benefit and the any one else who might want to try this project.

## My Methodology

I'm a big believer in systems thinking because it makes decisions easier and removes some of the emotion out of the process. 


, and using them to help guide actions. Even if you don't follow them exactly, the become a power way to make better decisions, and not get caught up in the emotions when we inventible run into road blocks. Below it the four step method that I am using with my student.

1. **Get it working.** A.k.a. Make a mess! In step one the objective is just to get some aspect of the project working. Can you make the wheels turn? Can you get an LED to light up? This step usually involevs making a giant mess and results in ugly code, or disorganized wiring.
2. **Get Organized.** Once we have working code, or working hardware then it's time to clean up the mess we made. This could mean reorganizing the wires or refactoring our code. The objective here is move forward with hardware/software that we know works but is not too messy.
3. **Get Feedback.** In this stage we test out our code to see what problems may occur. Feedback can come from other people, like when someone reviews our code. It's important to remember that we aren't going to get it right the first time, and this testing phase is an important part the best version of our project.
4. **Revise.** In this step we start to think about how to improve our work in the next version of the project. This could be adding features, or completely redoing some part of our project. In this stage, we take time to plan out, and research what we want to do. Finally we must embrace the fact that improving sometimes means making a mess again, so we have to be comfortable with returning to step 1.

## Plans for this project

- [x] Build a working buggy
- [ ] Remote control the buggy with another pie
- [ ] Remote control buggy over VPN
- [ ] Add all wheel drive (2 motors controller boards)
- [ ] Control the buggy using a USB gamepad
- [ ] Change buggy speed using a USB gamepad
- [ ] Add proximity sensors to prevent collisions
